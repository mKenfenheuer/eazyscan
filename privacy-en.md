## 2. Overview

EazyScan is a document scanning application for iOS.

The app is designed with privacy in mind and does not collect, store, transmit, or otherwise process personal data of users.

## 3. No Processing of Personal Data

When using EazyScan:

- No personal data is collected
- No personal data is stored
- No personal data is transmitted
- No personal data is analyzed
- No personal data is shared with third parties
- No tracking technologies are used
- No analytics services are integrated
- No advertising SDKs are implemented
- No user accounts are required

Accordingly, no processing of personal data within the meaning of Art. 4 GDPR takes place through the app itself.

## 4. Local Data Storage

All documents scanned with EazyScan are stored exclusively on the user's device.

The app does not have access to these documents beyond local device functionality. Data is only shared if the user actively uses Apple’s system-level sharing features (e.g., Mail, AirDrop, Files, iCloud, etc.).

## 5. Apple iOS and Third-Party Services

EazyScan runs on Apple’s iOS operating system.

Please note that Apple Inc. and its system services (e.g., iOS, iCloud, device analytics, App Store infrastructure) may independently process data under their own responsibility.

EazyScan has no influence over and assumes no responsibility for data processing carried out by Apple or other third parties via system-level services.

For more information, please refer to Apple’s Privacy Policy.

## 6. Legal Basis (Art. 6 GDPR)

Since EazyScan does not process personal data, no legal basis under Art. 6 GDPR is required for app usage itself.

If you contact us via email, any personal data you provide will be processed solely for the purpose of responding to your inquiry under Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR (legitimate interest in responding to inquiries).

## 7. Data Subject Rights (Art. 15–21 GDPR)

Under the GDPR, you have the following rights:

- Right of access (Art. 15 GDPR)
- Right to rectification (Art. 16 GDPR)
- Right to erasure (Art. 17 GDPR)
- Right to restriction of processing (Art. 18 GDPR)
- Right to data portability (Art. 20 GDPR)
- Right to object (Art. 21 GDPR)
- Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority (Art. 77 GDPR)

Since EazyScan does not process personal data, these rights generally do not apply in relation to app usage itself.

## 8. Data Retention

As no personal data is processed, no retention periods apply.

If you contact us via email, we retain correspondence only as long as necessary to handle your request.

## 9. International Data Transfers

EazyScan does not transfer personal data to third countries.

However, Apple services may involve international data transfers under Apple’s responsibility.

## 10. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy if required by legal or technical changes. The current version will always be available within the app or on the App Store page.
